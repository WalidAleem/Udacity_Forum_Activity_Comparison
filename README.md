# Udacity_Forum_Activity_Comparison

Udacity_Forum_Activity_Comparison_Male_Vs_Female  is my participation in the Project Showcase Challenge that has been announced
during the challenge phase of Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship (May 2018-Jul 2018). 

## Project requirements 

The participant have the opportunity to show how he/she took the scholarship course and applying it to real-life data sets. 
The participants have been requested to analyze and present data that addresses an interesting issue impacting their communities or the world. These topics can cover social issues, small/local business, the economy, healthcare, the environment, etc. 
The project is to be submitted as slideshow that shares findings and recommendations. Projects should be relevant to course concepts covered- they can go beyond what’s covered in the challenge course, but should be data-related.

## Project Expectations

* No more than 4 slides outlining the following:  
   * what question is the data answering?
   * What was the participant’s hypothesis?
   * What the processes for evaluating the data?
* Must Include at least 1 visualization that illustrates participant's finding
* Include a conclusion that outlines findings
* In total, the participant should submit no more than 6 slides. All presentations must be created using Google Slides.
